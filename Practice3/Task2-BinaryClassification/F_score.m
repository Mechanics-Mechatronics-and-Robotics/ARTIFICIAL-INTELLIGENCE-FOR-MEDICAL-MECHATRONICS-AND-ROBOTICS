function F1=F_score(net,H,targets)
%Compute accuracy for binary classification

n=length(targets);%# of samples
F1=0;%initialisation
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the F1 = 2*Precision*Recall/(Precision+Recall)
%                    Precision=TruePositives/(TruePositives+FalsePositives) 
%                    Recall =  TruePositives/(TruePositives+FalseNegatives) 
% Hint: You can use matrix and logic opetations as well as we did it in
%       accuracy_calc.m
